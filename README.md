# Harlaw

Transform DSL (Lingvo Dictionary File) files to JSON. Formatting options available for custom output.

There are many dictionaries available as .dsl, but very few in easily consumable formats. Harlaw formats the dsl files to json with decent search/replace/remove options.

Rust port of original [Node.js library](https://github.com/stscoundrel/harlaw).

### Install

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
harlaw = "1.0.0"
```


#### What's in the name?

In G.R.R Martins "A Song Of Ice And Fire", there is a character named Rodrik Harlaw. He is mockingly called "The Reader". That is what my Harlaw does too; reads things no one else cares about.
